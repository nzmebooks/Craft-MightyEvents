# Mighty Events

Mighty Events is a simple module that gives you the ability to track event attendance, as well as communicate with attendees for each event.

## Features
The module is very-much in an alpha stage. Indeed, it even has placeholder text in the administration area. It is fully-functional, but it simply provides a front-end form with attendance tracking on the back-end. Future features are outlined below.

## Additions
- Per-event attendee tracking
- Allow attendees to update their RSVP, if logged in
- Attendee notifications about event information
- Accept payments for event attendance
